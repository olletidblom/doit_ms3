## 🎨 Design

### 🎨 Colours
A modern minimalistic colour scheme was used to keep the UI clean and easy to read.

### 🎨 Fonts
Georiga was used to ensure a professional and legible typeface.

### 🎨 Structure
The site follows a **dashboard-style layout**, with an intuitive **task management interface**.

# Database

- Built with Python and the Django framework using PostgreSQL for production (Heroku deployment).
- The database consists of three main models: `User`, `Category`, `Task`, and `Profile`.

<details><summary>Show diagram</summary>
<img src="docs/images/doiterd.png">
</details>

---

## User Model
The `User` model (from Django's built-in authentication system) contains the following fields:

- `id`
- `password`
- `last_login`
- `is_superuser`
- `username`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `is_staff`
- `is_active`
- `date_joined`

---

## Category Model
The `Category` model represents task categories and contains:

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name` (CharField, max length: 100)
- `user` (ForeignKey to `User`, `CASCADE` on delete)

**Meta Constraints:**
- Unique constraint on `name` per `user`.

---

## Task Model
The `Task` model represents individual tasks and contains:

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user` (ForeignKey to `User`, `CASCADE` on delete, related name: `tasks`)
- `title` (CharField, max length: 255)
- `description` (TextField, nullable)
- `completed` (BooleanField, default: `False`)
- `created_at` (DateTimeField, auto_now_add=True)
- `updated_at` (DateTimeField, auto_now=True)
- `category` (ForeignKey to `Category`, `SET_NULL` on delete, nullable, related name: `tasks`)

---

## Profile Model
The `Profile` model stores additional user details and contains:

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user` (OneToOneField to `User`, `CASCADE` on delete)
- `fname` (CharField, max length: 50, nullable)
- `lname` (CharField, max length: 50, nullable)
- `bio` (RichTextField, max length: 300, nullable)
- `location` (CharField, max length: 100, nullable)
- `birthdate` (DateField, nullable)
- `updated_at` (DateTimeField, default: `timezone.now`)

### Signals:
A `post_save` signal is used to automatically create a `Profile` for each new `User` instance.

```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_user_profile(instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)
```

### 🎨 Wireframes
Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan the UI structure.
